<h1>Gareth Bezett's New Testament Translations</h1><h2>John</h2><h3>Chapter 1</h3><b>John 1:1</b>: In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.<br><b>2:</b> He was with God in the beginning.<br><b>3:</b> all things were made through him and without him not one thing was made that exists.<br><h3>Chapter 9</h3><b>John 9:1</b>: And passing, he saw a man blind from birth<br><b>2:</b> and his disciples questioned him saying, "Rabbi, who sinned, him or his parents, that he was born blind?"<br><b>3:</b> Jesus replied "neither this man or his parents sinned, but so that the works of God might be revealed in him.<br><b>4:</b> It is necessary for us to do the works of the one who sent me; night is coming when it is not possible to work.<br><b>5:</b> While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."<br><b>6:</b> Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud from the saliva and spread the mud on his eyes <br><b>7:</b> and said to him," Go wash in the pool of Siloam" (which means Sent).  He went and wash and came seeing.<br><b>8:</b> Now the neighbours and the people had seen before that he was a beggar said, "Is this not the same who sat and begged?"<br><b>9:</b> Some said, "It is him."  Some said "It is not, but someone like him."  This one said "it is me."<br><b>10:</b> Then they said to him, "How were your eyes opened?<br><b>11:</b> He replied, "The man called Jesus made mud and smeared my eyes and said to me 'Go in the Siloam and wash" then I went and washed.  I went and washed and saw again"<br><b>12:</b> and they said to him, "Where is he?"  He said "I do not know."<br><b>13:</b> They took him to the Pharisees, the one who had been blind.<br><b>14:</b> it was the sabbath at the time Jesus made mud and opened his eyes.<br><b>15:</b> Again the Pharisees asked him how he saw.  But he said to them, "He put mud in my eyes and I washed and saw."<br><b>16:</b> Then, some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not of God, because he does not keep the Sabbath."  And others said "How is a sinful man able to work these signs?" And there wasw division among them.<br><b>17:</b> They said to the blind man again, "What do you say about him that opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."<br><b>18:</b> The Judeans didn't believe him believe about him that he was blind and saw until they called the parents of the one who has received his sight.<br><b>19:</b> And they questioned them saying, "Is this your son who you say was born blind?  How then does he see now?"<br><b>20:</b> His parents replied and said, "We know this is our son and that he was born blind.  <br><b>21:</b> We do not know how sees now or who opened his eyes we don't know.  Ask him, he is of age, he will speak for himself."<br><b>22:</b> His parents said these things because they feared the Judeans.  For already the Judeans had agreed that anyone confessing him as messiah would be expelled from the synagogue.<br><b>23:</b> For this reason, his parents said, "He is of age, ask him."<br><b>24:</b> Therfore they called the man a second time who was blind and said to him, "Give glory to God we know that this man is a sinner."<br><b>25:</b> He replied to them, "I do not know if this man is a sinner, I know I was blind and now I see."<br><b>26:</b> They said to him, "What did he do to you?  How were your eyes opened?"<br><b>27:</b> He replied to them, "I already told you and you did not listen.  Why do you want to hear it again?  Do you want to become his discipes too?"<br><b>28:</b> They reproached him and said, "You are a disiple of this man, we are disiples of Moses.<br><b>29:</b> We know that God spoke to Moses, we do not know where this man is from."<br><b>30:</b> The man replied and said to them, "Indeed it is amazing that you do not know where his is from, and he opened my eyes.<br><b>31:</b> We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if one is pious and does his will, he will listen to such a one.<br><b>32:</b> Who has ever heard from the beginning of the world of someone opening the eyes of someone born blind?<br><b>33:</b> If he is not from God, he would not be able to do anything."<br><b>34:</b> The replied and said to him, "You were born entirely in sin, and you teach us?" And they threw him out.<br><b>35:</b> Jesus heard that they had thrown him out and having found him and said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"<br><b>36:</b> He answered him and said, "And who is he, Lord, that I might believe in him?"<br><b>37:</b> Jesus said to him, "And you have seen him and the one speaking to you is he."<br><b>38:</b> He said, "I believe, Lord." And he worshipped him.<br><b>39:</b> And Jesus said, "I came into this world to in judgement, so that the one who does not see should see and those that see would become blind."<br><b>40:</b> Some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this and said to him, "We are not blind are we?"<br><h3>Chapter 11</h3><b>John 11:1</b>: There was a certain sick man, Lazaras from Bethany from the town of Mary and Martha his sisters.<br><b>2:</b> Mary was the one who annointed the Lord with ointment and dried his feet with her hair, it was her borther Lazaras who was sick.<br><b>3:</b> The the sisters sent to him saying, "Lord, the one you love is sick."<br><b>4:</b> When Jesus heard this he said, "This sickness is not to death but for the sake of the glory of God that the son of God might be glorified through it.<br><b>5:</b> Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.<br><b>6:</b> When he heard that he was sick, he stayed in the same place two more days.<br><b>7:</b> Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let us return to Judea again."<br><b>8:</b> The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, just now the Judeans wanted to stone you and you are going there again?"<br><b>9:</b> Jesus replied, "Are there not twelve hours in the day?  If any walk in the day, they do not stumble, because they see the light of this world<br><b>10:</b> If any walk by night, they stumble because the light is not in them."<br><b>11:</b> He said these things and with this he said to them, "Lazarus our brother has fallen asleep, but I so that I might wake him."<br><b>12:</b> Then the disciples said to him, "Lord if he has fallen asleep he will recover?"<br><b>13:</b> But Jesus was talking about his death.  But theu thought he was talking about resting in sleep.<br><b>14:</b> Then Jesus said to them clearly, "Lazarus has died,<br><b>15:</b> and for your sake Iam  glad of this, so that you will believe but let us go to him."<br>
